       <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
through some interesting places on the way: <br> 
       <ol>
          <li>Walla Walla</li>
          <li> WA</li>
          <li>Magic City</li>
          <li>BID</li>
          <li>Bountiful</li>
          <li>UT</li>
          <li>Last Chance</li>
          <li>CO</li>
          <li>Truth or Consequences</li>
          <li>NM</li>
          <li>Why</li>
          <li>AZ</li>
       </ol> 
       </p>

      <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: <br> 
      <q>Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity.</q><br> 
      I definitely won't be passing any cars.
      </p>
      <br> 
      <br> 

    <em>July 14, 2012</em><br>
    <p>My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:<br> 
    <ul>
       <li>cellphone</li>
       <li>iPod</li>
       <li>digital camera</li>
       <li>a protein bar</li>
    </ul> <br> 
    Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said,<q><em>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</em></q>
